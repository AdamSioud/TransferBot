## About The Project


An application that can frontrun telegrambots on cmc listings. 
Has a dashboard that shows upcomming listings, and the most recents ones. 
The application can buy, sell, and transfer tokens via bsc and eth. It has a sleek and intuivtie UI. 
The bot itself could be ran on a server with a repeat time of 1.33 seconds, to catch upcomming listings. That is the main function of this application.
More fun things will be added soon to the application soon:)
